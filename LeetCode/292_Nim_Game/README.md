# Nim Game

## Problem：

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
 </p>
 <ol id="hints">
  <li class="hint">
   If there are 5 stones in the heap, could you figure out a way to remove the stones such that you will always be the winner?
  </li>
 </ol>
